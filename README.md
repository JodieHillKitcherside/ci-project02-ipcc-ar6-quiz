# IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report Quiz

/_ --------- All to edit for current project _/
The IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report Quiz has been created to test the user's knowledge based on the report findings, and will provide explanations and further depth to any understanding the user had on our current global warming status.
The quiz' main target market group includes both the public (average joe or jaspreet!), and those with knowledge in the sector currently: private sector, public sector, investors, scientists and activists, all working towards reducing gloabl warming. This target market group has such a huge varitety of typical users, and therefore the quiz has been designed for those with any level of knowledge. If a user doesn't have any context to the questions, then they can simply guess and recieve the correct answer and facts to boost their knowledge. For users that are already focussing work in the sctor, the quiz provides extra depth and controversial facts as to how we advance our efforts to reducing warming.
An ideal user would be members from product development in RnD across industry sectors, asset managers, policy makers, UN advisory group memebers and so forth; (typically those who have not read the report page to page) and in order to educate on the means neccessary to achieve, and in some way redirect our efforts, for reduction of gloabl warming.

## Stand Out Features

### Tables

- All tables are media responsive, and have a scroll bar in order to allow the user to access the information without looking font size for smaller screen accessibilty. All tables will be updated with each week match information. Some tables have borders that sit beside other tables and do no interact with each other accross various screen sizes. There is a light red/ pink highlight for the table row as the user hover, in order to make this specific data set stand out to the user.
  ![BCFCLS Tables](assets/images/screenshots-readme/tables.jpg)

### Gallery

- All images are stored to the right as you scroll. Each week the team manager will update with more images to add, at which we will add captions.
- All videos are stored with a select play/ pause/ stop.
  ![BCFCLS Images](assets/images/screenshots-readme/gallery-video-press-play.png)

### Features left to implement

1. Javascript link to pay for the season team placement fee.
2. More images on the Fixtures and Team page to add animation to the page.
3. Recruitment page with form application.

## Design

- Red colour chosen throughout html header, headings and borders to match the colours of the team home colours. Red has also been used to aplly a sport style bold alert, and to draw attention for the user.
- Complimentary tones of grey and lighter red/ pink been identified to add texture to the design yet not loose focus from the red and white theme.
- In order to reduce the white background, more borders could be considered or images added.
- The header has been centralised and is larger in order to be stand out on any device. Could have applied a reduced header bar, however in order to be stand out and look different to the Bristol City FC main football club, a larger header has been chosen in order not to confuse the user.

### Validator Testing

## HTML

- No errors were returned when passing the index.html through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjodiehillkitcherside.github.io%2Fproject1-bcfcls%2F)

## Code Testing

- Social - Twitter Link: Twitter timeline and the 'follow @' button both open in a new tab, directly to the teams twitter page.
- Social - Event link to map page: Event box suggests a link to the fixtures page where the map is.
- Media Response (shown as MR in table below) - all checked through dev tools in Chrome and on various mobile devices.
  ![Testing Excel Sheet](assets/images/screenshots-readme/testing-excel.jpg)

## Media Response

- Pages are designed to adjust items in to a column and centrally read as media devices get smaller.
- Logo and menu text adjusts dependant on the screen size.
- Maps, all tables, and main images all re-size depandant on the screen. Tables and divs have overflow scroll bar options when re-sized.
- Borders and divs have been placed not to over spill.
- All headings have been targeted under 800px to algin with the header text. As h1 has been used throughout the main body, this was important to reduce at a smaller screen size.

# MR finds to consider

- Images on Team, Quotes and Mentions section and some borders for media screen below 360 (Samsung Galaxy 8 size)
- Hero image - have done the best to object-fill but not background cover. The smaller the screen gets, again below 360px, this image begins to cut width.

Examples:

## Lighthouse

- Main points of feedback were due to the paint colour, sizing of headings and header per page and speed to load these.
- The site displays a red colour for both the user team's home colours and representation and further for accessibility.
- One of the team players has a blinding in one eye and the bold titles and title colours make this more accessible for this user.
- Could re-consider the design for better performance.
  ![Lighthouse Checks](assets/images/screenshots-readme/lighthouse.jpg)

## Wave

- No errors or contrast errors on all pages
- Examples of alerts: - Gallery - images and videos miss caption - would add captions for all media on gallery page with feedback per upload from the bcfcls team, features to add. - Team - missing headings or alternative text in quotes and mentions - the headings have been used to style from the h1/h2/h3/h4 in the main body css and body p font would not suit the format.
  ![Wave Checks](assets/images/screenshots-readme/wave.png)

### Solved Bugs

- Logo and h1 in the header would not display side by side without an imposed margin, the design did not fit well. Instead, the logo and h1 are positioned parralel and central to keep the design fluid independant of the screen size.
- Hero Image did not suit to cover screen as a background due to the image quality. Instead, the hero image has been set to fill and image rendering; auto. This is a much clear picture.
- W3 HTML Validator highlighted unclosed divs or sections missed (2) errors that have been updated.
- Jigsaw CSS Validator highlighted a margin: none used for the media response on the fantasy ules table section, which has been chnaged to 5px.
- Images nested in between divs on the fixtures page would not size adjust well with the flex display command in situ. Similarly, images on the social page also followed the same pattern. These images have been removed for now.

### Unsolved Bugs

- Social Page Twitter Timeline rendering in Firefox not so good - unsure how to implement change.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages.

- Header, Nav and Footer first inspired by the Love Running Project, which have been really edited fit for this website.
- Thanks to the Code Institute Tutors: Sean, Sarah, Gemma and Joanne who really helped with media response confusion for various sections and items across media device sizes.
- Thanks to my mentor Lauren-Nicole Popich who has been all start amazing at simplifying the break down of displaying items flex and how to assemble multple sections, divs within divs. The use of sketching intention and working through what needed a div or needed to be put in to another div section, then flexed, has really provided help.
