                This year’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) was an
                eight-year long
                undertaking from the world’s most authoritative scientific body on climate change.
                The report concludes on:
            <ul>
                <li>The devastating consequences of rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide</li>
                <li>The expected loss of livelihoods and the fragmentation of communities</li>
                <li>The increasingly dangerous and irreversible risks should we fail to change course</li>
                <li>The pathways to avoid these intensifying risks</li>
            </ul>
            Looking forward, and ahead of UNFCCC COP28 hosted in Dubai this year, the following quiz is a summary on
            the current status of global warming, preceding the report.
            <br>
            <br>
            How much do you know about the current consequence of global warming? What are the best actions for
            mitigation and adaptation, and how, where possible, can we prevent further global destruction?
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't worry if you do not know a lot about either the report or current status of global wamring, feel free
            to guess and we will provide key findings alongside the answers.
