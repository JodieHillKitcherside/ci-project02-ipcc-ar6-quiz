                        The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) was
                        an
                        eight-year long
                        undertaking from the world’s most authoritative scientific body on climate change.
                        The report concludes on:

                    <ul id="quiz-bio-list">
                        <li>The devastating consequences of rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide</li>
                        <li>The expected loss of livelihoods and the fragmentation of communities</li>
                        <li>The increasingly dangerous and irreversible risks should we fail to change course</li>

                        This year, announcements were made early July indicating that the UK has rennounced it's 2019 COP26 pledge to 'double the UK's international climate finance contributions, promising at least £11.6bn between by 2025-26'.
                        Despite the descouragement of announcements like these, this quiz has been created based on the <em>IPCC's AR6 Synthesis Report</em>, in order to reveal the critical status of global warming and inspire action forwards.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How much do you know about the current consequence of global warming? What are the best actions
                        for
                        mitigation and adaptation, and how, where possible, can we prevent further global destruction?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Don't worry if you do not know a lot about either the report or current status of global
                        warming, feel free to guess and we will provide key findings alongside the answers.

                        <p>Now you know more about the report findings from this year; we hope this
                        ultimately impacts our
                        progress -
                        whether that be making you more aware, condisering new habits or challenging your team at work
                        to be
                        productive for the planet.
                        However best we can work towards reducing global warming, we have a number of years to make a
                        difference before we cause irreversible devestation.
                        <br>
